// Dragon class that holds one dragon instance.

// Needs two fields, 
	//one pointing to this dragon in the XML tree
	//one for a DragonDisplay object

//Should have Get and Set methods for all bits of data/ fields
// eg getID() and setID(int ID)
// all the data bits are the ones in https://gist.github.com/EMBTonkin/6e824478e44fe907434f under the Dragon tag
// for space separated values just return them all in one go (make one getColors method, not three)

// Data should be stored directly in the XML thing and interacted directly with it
// so no ID field.  Just change the ID in the XML.  
// am I being unclear?  Probably.  Get in touch via the most convenient medium and I will clarify.

// Aslo include comments and print functions for testing a stuff.  Good design, you know.
