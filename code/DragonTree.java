// class to hold the Dragons
// is the Model in the Model View Controller scheme.  

//Needs these methods:
	// a init method that reads in dragons from a file and places them in dragon objects
	// another version where it starts with no file and creates an empty XML object
	// save(str fileName): take the current dragon objects and save them in a .drg file
	// getDragon(int ID): a method to get a dragon by it's ID
	// getGeneration(int gen): a method to get all dragons in a certain 'generation'
	// getActiveDragons(): a method to get all dragons that are not 'exalted'
	// addDragon(Dragon dragon, Dragon mother, Dragon father): adds a dragon to the tree structure, where the parants cane be Null to signify first gen
	// exalt(Dragon dragon): exalt the current dragon.  Could do any number of things depending on object's internal structure, so do this one last.
	// include any helper functions you might need.
	
// Aslo include comments and print functions for testing a stuff.  Good design, you know.
