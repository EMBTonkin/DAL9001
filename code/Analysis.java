// why not put all the logical comparisons in one place? 

// Fields necessary will be color info (color name and hexadecimal for each color; see colorInfo.txt)
// and breed and gene rarities and a table to compare them to each other

// Methods:
	// canBreed(Dragon dragon1, Dragon dragon2): Can two dragons breed together?  Check MatingType and ancestry.  Returns Boolean (The data type, not the familiar)
	// colorRange(string color1, string color2): two colors enter, a list of color names of the potential range leaves.
	// getColorHex(string color): returns the hexadecimal number associated with a color name
	// âˆš (done) rarityCompare(string gene1, string gene2): takes in the name of two genes (or two dragon breeds) and returns two percentages, saying the likely hood of each gene for the offspring.  If same, both are 100%
	// As the DAL program grows, more analysis will be added, and it will be here.  
	
// Aslo include comments and print functions for testing a stuff.  Good design, you know.
